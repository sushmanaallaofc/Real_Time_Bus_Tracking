# REAL_TIME_BUS_TRACKER
## Description
Using the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT with an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.
# Installation
Use this command to install 
git clone : https://github.com/sushmanaallaofc/Real_Time_Bus_Tracking

# Working
## Step 1:
Create a Mapbox account and get the access token .Add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapanimation.js
## Step 2:
Create a marker and add it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions.
## Step 3:
The function move() is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" is selected. This is how you can start the marker animation.
If your code works, you should be able to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
